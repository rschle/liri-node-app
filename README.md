# liri-node-app

Liri node app is somewhat like siri, but also somewhat different. It takes in certain commands in node and communicates with a selection of API's to provide a response for those commands. This liri node app carries out a command using the bands in town api (returning information of concerts nearby relating to a particular keyword of the artist that the user types in) as well as spotify songs (using the node-spotify api). These two commands in particular make use of the node package axios. The liri-node-app also uses the OMDB api to provide information about the movie that the user has typed in after the respective command. Additionally, the app responds to a default "do-what-it-says" command by reading what is written in a txt file and executing the command from there (one of the 3 already described). As you can see, this app is quite versatile. Try it for yourself or see how it works here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Fizt2w_0w&feature=youtu.be!
